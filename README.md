Robot Tending Kit for Tormach ZA6 Robot and Versabuilt MultiGrip

## Safety First!
Not to start off a project with a downer, but it's imperative that you understand that any operations involving robot tending with or without use of this system are inherently dangerous if proper procedures are not followed. Always maintain a safe distance between operator and robot, and be judicious with your use of automation in a production environment. Serious injury and expensive damage can occur at any time if you make an error, and you need to be protected from that and any consequences of that failure. Be safe, have fun, and make some great parts!
