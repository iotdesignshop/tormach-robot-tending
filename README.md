Robot Tending Kit for Tormach ZA6 Robot and Versabuilt MultiGrip

## Safety First!
Not to start off a project with a downer, but it's imperative that you understand that any operations involving robot tending with or without use of this system are inherently dangerous if proper procedures are not followed. Always maintain a safe distance between operator and robot, and be judicious with your use of automation in a production environment. Serious injury and expensive damage can occur if you instruct your robot to do something untested and are not monitoring it from a safe distance. Be safe, have fun, and make some great parts!
